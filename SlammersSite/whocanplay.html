<h1>Who Can Play?</h1>

<p>There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week.
    Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.<br>
    Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will
    help them get fit without pushing them to their limit.
</p>
<p> For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense,
    but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.<br>
    Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.
    Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.
