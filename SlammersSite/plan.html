<p>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan Name: Slammers Beach
Volleyball</p>
<p> Goals</p>
<p>To increase the amount of weekly participants from 100 to at least
150. Attracting a younger audience of 15-30 year-olds is also
important to the club. The website should promote volleyball as a fun
family sport. 
</p>
<p>Success Evaluation 
</p>
<p>The amount of people signing up due to the site can be determined
by how many people use the sign-up form on the website. Alternatively
if they are signing up at the club they can fill in a section asking
&ldquo;where did you hear about us?&rdquo; which would determine if
they found the club via the website.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>The target audience of this site is predominately 15-30 year-olds
as this an age range that is not currently marketed towards. However
the site can also provide an overall increase in popularity
regardless of age group.<br>
	This goal will be achieved by making an accessible website that appeals towards a younger crowd.
